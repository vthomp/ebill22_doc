Description:
===========
 
Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY**
pre-installation activity associated with this install.
 
The Integrated Billing (IB) Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission 
queue PRIOR to the installation of this patch.
 
Please reference instructions from the Pre/Post Installation Overview for 
further details.
 
Integrated Billing (IB) is a software module within Veterans Health
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides
the ability for billing personnel to submit claims in either a paper or
electronic format to third-party payers.
 
The following features of the IB software will be affected by this 
patch:
 
   * Cloning a Primary Claim
 
     The option Copy and Cancel [IB COPY AND CANCEL], cancels the bill
     associated with the bill number entered by the user.  It also
     creates a new bill, with a new bill number.  If the original bill
     is a primary claim (destination payer is the primary payer) and it
     has one or more associated Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice
     (MRA) or Explanation of Benefits (EOB), then the new primary claim
     will now copy the COB data from the MRA/EOB to the new primary
     claim correctly.
 
   * Field Length Adjustments
 
     The IB VistA package has the ability to send proprietary
     professional and institutional medical claims to Financial Services
     Center(FSC).  These claims contain data that is used by FSC to
     create transactions that comply with the X12N/005010X222 Health
     Care Claim (837) and X12N/005010X223 Health Care Claim (837)
     standards.  Where possible, the IB software has been modified so
     that claim data can be transmitted in updated data element sizes,
     in the proprietary claim messages sent to FSC, that are compliant
     with the latest version of the 837 standards.  The IB software has
     also been modified to allow the entry of longer data.  This change
     ensures that the third party payers receive and process claims and
     distribute payments to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
     without any issues caused because VistA could not capture or store
     data elements as long as those allowed by the standards.
 
   * Unit or Basis for Measurements Codes for Drugs
 
     Previously, when creating professional and institutional bills for
     submission to payers, the system automatically defaulted to Unit as
     the type of measurement and users were unable to choose another
     type of measurement.  Users were prompted to enter only the
     quantity of units. 
 
     The billing staff needed to be able to submit the correct type of
     units or basis for measurement codes and a quantity of units for
     medications provided during appointments.  These units or basis for
     measurement codes are specific to the National Drug Code associated
     with the medication.
 
     The system has been updated to allow for different types of
     measurement (qualifiers) to be available to users.  Users can enter
     ?? to display the available selections for a Unit or Basis for
     Measurement code. The default value for unit or basis of
     measurement continues to be Unit.  
 
     The following units or basis for measurement codes have been made
     available from which billing staff can select:
        o  F2  - International Unit
        o  GR - Gram
        o  ME - Milligram
        o  ML - Milliliter
        o  UN - Unit
 
   * Print NDC Number on UB04
 
     The IB VistA package has been modified to print the type of unit or
     basis for measurement on Form Locator 43 on a locally printed UB04
     claim form.  This is in addition to the printing of a non-
     prescription National Drug Code (NDC) number and the quantity of
     the medication delivered that previously printed on the UB04 claim
     form.
 
   * Process Payer ID - Store HCCH Payer ID
 
     The Integrated Billing (IB) VistA package has been modified so
     that for when there is no Professional or Institutional Payer ID
     defined in VistA and a claim (or claims) is transmitted to the
     payer(s) and the Health Care Clearing House (HCCH) has an
     electronic agreement with the payer(s), the HCCH is to do a lookup
     of the Payer IDs and return them to VistA in a 277STAT transaction.
     The VistA software now uses the Payer IDs in the 277STAT message
     to update the Payer IDs for the corresponding companies in the
     Insurance Company file (#36) when those fields are blank.
 
     The system now processes a 277STAT message from Health Care
     Clearing House (HCCH) and evaluates/updates Payer IDs as follows:
        o  Update the Insurance file, field EDI ID NUMBER - PROF
           [#36,3.02] or EDI ID NUMBER - INST [#36,3.04] with the Payer
           IDs from the 277STAT transaction only when the value that is
           on file is blank.  When these fields are updated new data
           elements to capture changes are also updated along with the
           date of update for reporting purposes.
        o  If the Payer ID from the 277STAT transaction is different
           than what is stored and it is not blank, then no update
           occurs, but the data is stored with the new data elements
           including the date for reporting purposes only.
 
     Also the intermittent issue of updating EDI ID numbers when there
     is no value stored, has been resolved. 
 
   * Payer ID Report
 
     A new report has been created which, based on a specified period
     of time, identifies what Insurance Company payers identification
     numbers (EDI ID NUMBER - PROF [#36,3.02] or EDI ID NUMBER - INST
     [#36,3.04] the system has either changed or attempted to change
     as a result of a 277STAT message received from the Health Care
     Clearing House (HCCH).

*  In PRODUCTION, there is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation activity  *
*  associated with this install.                                        *
*                                                                       *

*  the installation of this patch.                                      *
*************************************************************************
    
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO EMPTY THE 837 EXTRACT TRANSMISSION QUEUE:
===============================================================
The site Information Resource Management (IRM) MUST coordinate with the
Billing Department to insure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
empty. Once the Billing Department has completed the instructions, the 
Billing department is to inform IRM that the patch installation may 
proceed.
   
The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
Select the option: TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL TRANSMIT]
    
  What is the purpose of this option?
   This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
   queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
    
  When is this option used?
   There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
   immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
   in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
   claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
     
  Upon selecting this option you will be prompted with the following:
    Select one of the following:
     A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
     S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
    
  You should select 'A' for ALL
     
There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated with
this patch.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
The Pre-install routine (IBY577PR) will automatically do the following:
 *     Update entries used by the Forms Output Utility [IBCE OUTPUT 
       FORMATTER].
 *     Add a new entry in IB ERROR file (#350.8).
   
The Post-install (IBY577PO) will automatically do the following:
 *     Recompile the Billing Screen Input Templates
 *     Survey the Form Type file (#353) to identify which form numbers
       are being used at the site.  Then an email will be attempted to
       be sent to the MCCF EDI TAS Development Team with this information
       which will be used to determine which form numbers are available
       for future development.
    
Routines IBY577PO and IBY577PR may be manually deleted by IT/IRM upon
completion of the installation.
 
 
Installation Instructions
-------------------------
This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2 
minutes to install.
 
1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
 
2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
 
3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
    following options:
 
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
        is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
        you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
        transport global.
     
4.  To Install the Patch, from the Installation Menu, select the Install
    Package(s) option and choose the patch to install. When prompted for
    the INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # (ex. XXX*X.X*XX)
 
5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
    Install? NO//'  You may press return to accept the default answer of 
    NO IF your system rebuilds menu trees nightly using TaskMan. If you 
    do not have this scheduled as a nightly task, you must answer YES to 
    rebuild the menu trees.  This could affect users on the system 
    and your installation time will increase.
 
6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    NO//, enter 'NO'
 
7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
    and Protocols? NO//, enter 'NO'
