Description:
===========
 
Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY**
pre-installation activity associated with this install.
 
The Integrated Billing (IB) Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission 
queue PRIOR to the installation of this patch.
 
Please reference instructions from the Pre/Post Installation Overview for 
further details.
 
IB is a software module within Veterans Health Information Systems and
Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides the ability for billing
personnel to submit claims in either a paper or electronic format to
third-party payers.
 
The following features of the IB software will be affected by this 
patch:
 
   * eBilling Set Onset Date Appropriately
 
     When completing professional health care claims, the eBilling system 
     automatically defaulted the date of service as the onset date when
     there is no Occurrence code with the correct date the current illness
     or symptom first appeared.  There should only be a date if there is
     an Occurrence code for onset of illness or Last Menstrual Period
     (LMP).  The system should not automatically default the onset date to
     the date of service. 
 
     In support of this logic, the following fatal error message will be
     changed:
     
     **Errors**:
     Occ. codes for accident, LMP, illness not allowed on same bill
 
     The new fatal error message will no longer include accident.  
     Accident Occurrence codes are now printed in Box 15.  The new message
     will be the following:
 
     **Errors**
     Occ. codes Onset of Illness (11) and LMP (10) not allowed on same
     bill.
 
   * Missing MRW Legend Indicator
 
     When viewing claim responses on the MRA Management WorkList [IBCE MRA
     MANAGEMENT], staff needs the ability to see indicators that reflect
     the current status of the entry on the list in order to assist them
     with their workload.  There are currently several indicators that
     appear in front and behind bill numbers, but not all are found on the
     legend.  Staff needs the ability to also see the indicator for review
     in process on the legend.  
 
     This should be displayed in the legend as follows:
 
     *=review in process 
 
   * Printing of CMS 1500
 
     When printing CMS 1500 claim forms locally, billing staff must be
     able to print the bill frequency code and the original claim
     reference number, Internal Claim Number (ICN)/Document Control Number
     (DCN), for replacement of prior claims or void/cancel prior claims in
     the correct field locator (FL). The bill frequency code and ICN
     number do not currently print on the CMS 1500 form for replacement or
     voided/canceled claims.
 
     By printing the following bill frequency codes and the original claim
     reference number (ICN/DCN) on professional replacement claims for 
     non-Medicare payers (note: Medicare claims cannot be printed locally)
     in FL 22, payers are able to determine the correct status of the
     claim and process it accordingly and in a timely manner.
 
     Bill Frequency Code           Description
     7                             Replacement of prior claim
     8                             Void/Cancel of prior Claim
 
   * Correct an issue on Screen 10 for CMS-1500s
 
     A problem was found on Screen 10 while testing CMS-1500s.  It had to 
     do with the proper display of the "TERTIARY INSURANCE ICN/DCN" prompt
     which was displayed as "FORM LOCATOR 64C".
 
   * Payer Zip Code Field Adjustment 
 
     Users can currently enter a five or nine-digit zip code in the
     following payer address fields in the INSURANCE COMPANY (#36) file:
        
       * Main Mailing Address - ZIP CODE (#.116) field
       * Inpatient Claims Office Address - CLAIMS (INPT) PROCESS ZIP 
         (#.126) field
       * Appeals Address - APPEALS ADDRESS ZIP (#.146) field
       * Inquiry Address - INQUIRY ADDRESS ZIP CODE (#.156) field
       * Outpatient Claims Office Address - CLAIMS (OPT) PROCESS ZIP 
         (#.166) field
       * Prescription Claims Office Address - CLAIMS (RX) ZIP (#.186)
         field
 
     The fields are set up to accept the standard nine digit code, and
     users should be required to enter the maximum standard number of
     digits.  VistA IB should require users to enter a properly formatted
     and valid ZIP code that is nine digits long when entering a new ZIP
     code or editing an existing ZIP code.
 
     The process required to accomplish this functionality is outlined
     below:
 
       * VistA IB verifies that the ZIP code is a 9 character numeric  
         value.  
       * VistA IB verifies the last 4 digits are not 0000 or 9999. 
       * VistA does not make a 5 digit payer ZIP code a fatal error in 
         billing.
       * Payer address ZIP codes that exist at the time the software 
         updates are installed will not be changed.

Patch Installation:
 
 
Pre/Post Installation Overview
------------------------------
****Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY**
pre-installation activity associated with this install.
    
The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue
PRIOR to the installation of this patch. ***
    
The site Information Resource Management (IRM) should coordinate with the
Billing Department to insure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
empty. Once the Billing Department has completed the instructions, the 
Billing department is to inform IRM that the patch installation may 
proceed.
   
The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
   
Select the option:   TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL 
TRANSMIT]
    
  What is the purpose of this option?
   This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
   queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
    
  When is this option used?
   There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
   immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
   in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
   claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
     
  Upon selecting this option you will be prompted with the following:
    Select one of the following:
     A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
     S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
    
  You should select 'A' for ALL
     
There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated
with this patch.
   
The Pre-install routine (IBY576PR) will automatically do the following:
*     Update entries used by the Forms Output Utility [IBCE OUTPUT 
FORMATTER].
   
The Post-install (IBY576PO) will automatically do the following:
*     Recompile the Billing Screen Input Templates
*     Modify an existing entry in IB ERROR file (#350.8) or add entry if 
not found.
    
Routines IBY576PO and IBY576PR may be manually deleted by IT/IRM upon
completion of the installation.
