Description:
===========
 
Important Note: There is a **MANDATORY** pre installation activity
associated with this install.
 
Before install:
 
* Integrated Billing (IB) Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission
  queue PRIOR to the installation of this patch.
 
Please reference instructions from the Pre/Post Installation Overview for
further details. 
 
Integrated Billing (IB) is a software module within Veterans Health
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides
the ability for billing personnel to submit claims in either a paper or
electronic format to third-party payers.
 
The following features of the IB software will be affected by this 
patch:
 
   * Secondary Payer IDs
 
     Modified the IB software so that existing Insurance Company entries
     in the Insurance Company (#36) file have a defined EDI ID NUMBER -
     INST (#3.04) field and EDI ID NUMBER - PROF (#3.02) field in addition
     to Claim Office ID Qualifier and Claim Office ID number in the
     secondary ID fields : EDI INST SECONDARY ID QUAL(1) (#6.01), EDI INST
     SECONDARY ID(1) (#6.02), EDI INST SECONDARY ID QUAL(2) (#6.03), EDI
     INST SECONDARY ID(2) (#6.04), EDI PROF SECONDARY ID QUAL(1) (#6.05),
     EDI PROF SECONDARY ID(1) (#6.06), EDI PROF SECONDARY ID QUAL(2)
     (#6.07), EDI PROF SECONDARY ID(2)(#6.08) fields. When there is no
     Secondary Professional or Institutional Payer ID defined in VistA and
     a claim(s) is transmitted to the payer(s) and the Health Care
     Clearing House (HCCH) has an electronic agreement with the payer(s),
     the HCCH needs to do a lookup of the Payer IDs and return them to
     VistA in a 277STAT transaction.  The VistA software should use the
     Secondary Payer IDs in the 277STAT message to update the Payer ID and
     the Claim Office ID #s, including the Claim Office ID Qualifier and
     Payer IDs for the corresponding companies in the Insurance Company
     file (#36) when those fields are blank. If for some reason, an
     Insurance Company does not have any available fields for a Claim
     Office ID number, the attempt will be logged as "*N/A Full" on the
     corresponding report - HCCH Payer ID Report [IB HCCH PAYER ID 
     REPORT].
 
   * HCCH Payer ID Report [IB HCCH PAYER ID REPORT]- Secondary Payer ID
 
     Modified the HCCH Payer ID Report to allow user to
     run the report and include secondary payers for a specified period of
     time that identifies which Insurance Company payer identification
     numbers the system has either changed or attempted to change as a
     result of a 277STAT message received from the HCCH. Added a new
     column for "Clm-Off-ID" (Claim Office ID).  If the HCCH Payer ID
     Report contains any attempts with a value of "*N/A Full", the
     following legend will print under the report heading:  "'*' = No
     available fields to allow for an update in the insurance file".
 
   * Dental Claims Mock-up
 
     Modified the Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] 
     option, to allow the biller to see what information will be
     transmitted on a dental claim before completing. The IB software is
     able to generate a mock-up of the claim with the Dental data for
     viewing only after the users finish capturing all the information
     through billing screen 10.  The mock-up is similar in format to what
     is displayed for the CMS-1500, block 24. The software provides the
     users with the ability to correct the claim after the display of the
     mock-up.
 
   * Alternate Payer ID
 
     The IB software has been modified to submit a secondary claim
     (that contains an alternate payer ID) to the secondary payer using 
     the alternate payer ID, not the payer's primary Payer ID.
 
 
   * CSA-Separate TRICARE/CHAMPVA
 
     The VistA software has been modified to allow the user to sort the
     Claims Status Awaiting Resolution [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING] 
     Worklist to identify MCCF (Medical Care Collections Fund) and
     Non-MCCF claims.  The following new prompt has been provided to the
     user to allow for this new sorting feature:
 
            "Search by (M)CCF, (N)on-MCCF, or (B)oth? M//"
 
     When this patch is installed at a site, the Non-MCCF Rate Types
     List under section [12] Non-MCCF Pay-To Providers in the IB Site
     Parameters will be prepopulated with the following rate types and
     will be used for the Non-MCCF Claims search:
 
       o   CHAMPVA REIMB. INS.
       o   CHAMPVA
       o   TRICARE REIMB. INS.
       o   TRICARE
       o   INTERAGENCY
       o   INELIGIBLE
       o   INELIGIBLE REIMB. INS.
       o   SHARING AGREEMENT
 
     Other current Rate Types that are not listed above will be applied
     to the MCCF claims search.
 
 
   * Implement ROI (Release of Information)
 
     The VistA software has been modified to implement ROI
     changes so that the software is compliant with the
     Mission Act requirements.  To be compliant, the software has been
     modified in the following ways if the claim's Date of Service is
     on or after "01/28/2019":
 
     o  Will not prompt for the ROI form for a sensitive record.
 
     o  Will not prevent a claim from being completed for a sensitive
        record.
 
     o  Will send an "I" ("I"nformed consent to release Medical
        Information for Conditions or Diagnoses regulated by federal
        statutes) in piece 7 of the CL1 segment of the 837 messages
        to FSC.

*                                                                       *
*************************************************************************
  
HOW TO EMPTY THE 837 EXTRACT TRANSMISSION QUEUE:
===============================================================
The site Information Resource Management (IRM) MUST coordinate with the
Billing Department to ensure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
empty. Once the Billing Department has completed the instructions, the 
Billing department is to inform IRM that the patch installation may 
proceed.
   
The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
Select the option: TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL TRANSMIT]
    
  What is the purpose of this option?
   This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
   queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
    
  When is this option used?
   There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
   immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
   in the MCCR Site Parameters.  This option will allow sending
   individual claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
     
  Upon selecting this option, you will be prompted with the following:
    Select one of the following:
     A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
     S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
    
  You should select 'A' for ALL
     
There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated with
this patch.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
The Pre-install routine (IBY623PR) is used to screen claims output 
formatter file entries included with the build and clear out any
extraneous data associated with the entries before installing them.
   
The Post-install routine (IBY623PO) will automatically do the following:
 *     Add the "IBTAS,APPLICATION PROXY" user to the New Person file
       [#200].
 
 *     The Non-MCCF Rate Types List under section [12] Non-MCCF Pay-To
       Providers in the IB Site Parameters will be prepopulated with the
       following rate types and will be used for the Non-MCCF Claims
       search:
         o   CHAMPVA REIMB. INS.
         o   CHAMPVA
         o   TRICARE REIMB. INS.
         o   TRICARE
         o   INTERAGENCY
         o   INELIGIBLE
         o   INELIGIBLE REIMB. INS.
         o   SHARING AGREEMENT
       All other Rate Types that were previously defined in the system
