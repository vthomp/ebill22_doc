Description:
===========
 
Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY**
pre-installation activity associated with this install.
 
The Integrated Billing (IB) Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission 
queue PRIOR to the installation of this patch.
 
Please reference instructions from the Pre/Post Installation Overview for 
further details.
 
IB is a software module within Veterans Health
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides
the ability for billing personnel to submit claims in either a paper or
electronic format to third-party payers.
 
The following features of the IB software will be affected by this 
patch:
 
 
   * Dental Claims
     
     The IB package currently has the ability to send proprietary
     professional and institutional medical claims to the Financial 
     Services Center (FSC).  These claims contain data that is used by FSC
     to create compliant X12N/005010X222 Health Care Claim (837P) and
     X12N/005010X223 Health Care Claim (837I) transactions.  This patch
     enhances the IB package to create proprietary 837 dental claims with
     the data necessary to send FSC a transaction it can map to a
     X12N/005010X224 Health Care Claim (837D) when a user authorizes a
     dental claim.  Dental claims will only be Transmitted electronically
     and cannot be printed at this time.  This enhancement touched all
     aspects of the claims billing process.
 
 
   * Two minor prior defects were also addressed as part of this patch.
 
     The first occurred when a claim was on both the CSA - Claims Status 
     Awaiting Resolution [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING] and the CBW - COB 
     Management Worklist [IBCE COB MANAGEMENT] worklists.  If a biller
     tried to address on the CSA first, an error message would display and
     the user session would unexpectedly end.
 
     The second error occurred when a user selected Print MRA from the CBW
     but entered "^" instead of selecting a claim.  The option abruptly
     ended and has been changed to instead gracefully exit.

*                          IMPORTANT NOTE                               *
*  In PRODUCTION, there is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation activity  *
*  associated with this install.                                        *
*                                                                       *
*  The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to  *
*  the installation of this patch.                                      *
*************************************************************************
    
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO EMPTY THE 837 EXTRACT TRANSMISSION QUEUE:
===============================================================
The site Information Resource Management (IRM) MUST coordinate with the
Billing Department to ensure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
empty. Once the Billing Department has completed the instructions, the 
Billing department is to inform IRM that the patch installation may 
proceed.
   
The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
Select the option: TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL TRANSMIT]
    
  What is the purpose of this option?
   This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
   queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
    
  When is this option used?
   There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
   immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
   in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
   claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
     
  Upon selecting this option, you will be prompted with the following:
    Select one of the following:
     A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
     S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
    
  You should select 'A' for ALL
     
There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated with
this patch.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
The Pre-install routine (IBY592PR) will automatically do the following:
 *     Update entries used by the Forms Output Utility [IBCE OUTPUT 
       FORMATTER].
 *     Archive BILL FORM TYPE file (#353) Internal Entry Number (IEN) 7 so
       as not to impact the new dental form.  The BILL FORM TYPE file is a
       national file, but was found to include some entries at 3 VAMCs
       which need to be safely moved to another IEN (207).
 
The Post-install routine (IBY592PO) will automatically do the following:
 *     Add new entries to IB ERROR (#350.8) file
 *     Add new entries to TYPE OF SERVICE (#353.2) file
 *     Add new entry to IB ATTACHMENT REPORT TYPE (#353.3) file 
 *     Recompile the Input Templates for the billing screens
 *     Set default processing of dental claims to YES - IB SITE
       PARAMETERS (#350.9) File, DENTAL ENABLED? (#8.2) Field.
    
Routines IBY592PO and IBY592PR may be manually deleted by upon completion
of the installation.
